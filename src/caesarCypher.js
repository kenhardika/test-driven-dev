// what is caesar ciper?
// its an old text based cyphering technique made by Julius Caesar himself.
// basically, you set the cypher 'shift' number then, that number will be shifting letter ex: A=0, B=1. C=2. Translate A with shift= 2. Amswer is A = C, 
// because cypherLetter = shiftNum + letterNum so 2+0 = 2, what got number 2? thats "C".
console.log('Caesar Cypher')


function cypher(word){
    return word
}

export {cypher}
