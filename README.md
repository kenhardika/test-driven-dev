# test-driven-dev
TDD based project

Hello there people of code!
Right now in this project I write practice code with the idea of following TDD structure.

First I created the test file (name.test.js), I write the testing file on how my code should have work. Then I run the first test, it will automatically failed as it should.
Then try to figure out how to make the failed code works by solving them in js file. After that, run the test again and make sure the test is passed.
Next after the test passed, modify the test file to proceed progress to next step of what the code should works.

The Idea behind TDD is really good, makes you understand step-by-step approach of solving a problem. It's great to breakdown complicated code into much much simpler unit. Also when you're running the test, it's intuitively shows where you did wrong/right and visually represented by red/green test which is very neat.
